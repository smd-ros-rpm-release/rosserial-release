ros-indigo-rosserial-python (0.4.5-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Fix SeviceServer member names in error message
    'm' prefix was omitted, causing an exception while trying to print
    an error about md5 mismatches. Fix this to allow the error to be
    presented to the user.
  * Allow service calls with empty requests
    std_srvs::Empty has a request message of size zero. SerialClient.send
    returns the size of the sent message, which is checked to ensure
    data crossed the serial line. Accommodate services with empty requests
    by modifying the check to acknowledge all transmissions of zero or
    more bytes as valid.
  * revert name of node, add a few comments/spacing
  * fix private parameters - temporary fix breaks fork_server for tcp
  * Fix #35 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial/issues/35>
